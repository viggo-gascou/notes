            # ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Viggo!
            Welcome to my notes. I'm a data science student, and I use this site to keep track of things I learn.
            I'm currently studying at the <a href="https://en.itu.dk/" class="text-accent underline"> IT University of Copenhagen</a>.
            Take a look around, but keep in mind that the notes are a work in progress. So if something seems confusing or under-explained, it's probably either wrong or just not finished yet.
            <br />

            If you want to get see what I'm up to, you can check out my <a href="" class="text-accent">portfolio</a>.
